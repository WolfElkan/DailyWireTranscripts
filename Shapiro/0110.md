# [Episode CX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfxIf3frJuE&list=PLlVjFVMet3OXfEi7b2w50OUc7QMnpfKqK): Can The Trump Train Turn Hillary Into Roadkill?
<!-- 00:00 --> with the end of the Republican primaries
<!-- 00:02 --> in sight and Donald Trump the
<!-- 00:03 --> prohibitive favorite for the nomination
<!-- 00:05 --> critics of the never Trump movement have
<!-- 00:07 --> been out in force and they're trying to
<!-- 00:09 --> browbeat those of us who don't support
<!-- 00:10 --> Trump into embracing this demagogic
<!-- 00:13 --> loudmouth moron with tyrannical views of
<!-- 00:15 --> government and an incoherent quasi
<!-- 00:17 --> isolationist foreign policy so last week
<!-- 00:19 --> I talked about never Trump and I said
<!-- 00:21 --> never means never but here's a more
<!-- 00:24 --> important question given the fact that
<!-- 00:25 --> the Trump train is now barreling to helm
<!-- 00:28 --> the 2016 tracks what comes next for the
<!-- 00:31 --> Trump stirs now that they're whining
<!-- 00:33 --> mewling rage has brought about the
<!-- 00:35 --> nomination of the most leftist candidate
<!-- 00:37 --> in the gops history here's the question
<!-- 00:39 --> what do they do well they have to do
<!-- 00:41 --> three things first they inflate the myth
<!-- 00:43 --> of Trump Trump is the overwhelming
<!-- 00:45 --> favorite to lose according to every
<!-- 00:47 --> betting market he's currently at 18% at
<!-- 00:49 --> Betfair he's at 29% at Bovada predict
<!-- 00:53 --> wise gives him a 27% chance of winning
<!-- 00:55 --> the Republican presidency of the last 50
<!-- 00:57 --> head-to-head polls between Clinton and
<!-- 00:59 --> Trump Clinton's win Clinton wins 42 of
<!-- 01:01 --> them she ties three so Trump stirs have
<!-- 01:05 --> claimed for months their man is the only
<!-- 01:06 --> one who can beat Hillary so they have
<!-- 01:09 --> sort of a bind like the Joker in the
<!-- 01:11 --> Dark Knight they've now chased the car
<!-- 01:12 --> and they've bitten the bumper but now
<!-- 01:14 --> they don't know what to do with it so
<!-- 01:16 --> they'll pretend for just a few months
<!-- 01:18 --> that Trump will win today they're
<!-- 01:20 --> holding up a new Rasmussen poll it shows
<!-- 01:21 --> Trump ahead of Hillary 41 to 39 this
<!-- 01:24 --> they say shows Trump is competitive now
<!-- 01:26 --> put aside that Rasmussen polls were
<!-- 01:28 --> wildly off last time around in 2012
<!-- 01:30 --> instead focus on the fact that poll
<!-- 01:33 --> includes 15 percent of voters who say
<!-- 01:35 --> they want somebody else and another 5
<!-- 01:37 --> percent who are undecided
<!-- 01:38 --> no candidate in history has won an
<!-- 01:40 --> election with 41 percent of the vote
<!-- 01:42 --> without a third party candidate and
<!-- 01:44 --> there's no third-party candidate on the
<!-- 01:46 --> horizon beyond that the poll shows that
<!-- 01:48 --> Trump wins about 48 percent of white
<!-- 01:49 --> voters he needs 63% to be competitive
<!-- 01:52 --> with Hillary Clinton so in the absence
<!-- 01:54 --> of decent stats showing that would Trump
<!-- 01:57 --> would be competitive of Clinton they're
<!-- 01:59 --> starting to spin Michael wall she's a
<!-- 02:00 --> big Trump supporter over at the New York
<!-- 02:02 --> Post he says Trump can win he says quote
<!-- 02:04 --> you're darn right he can does anyone
<!-- 02:06 --> think that in the debates
<!-- 02:07 --> Hillary will be able to withstand the
<!-- 02:09 --> blunt-force trama the braggadocious
<!-- 02:11 --> billionaire deployed - not Jeb
<!-- 02:13 --> and his other rivals out of the race
<!-- 02:14 --> first off he didn't really knock crews
<!-- 02:17 --> out of the race with that same routine
<!-- 02:19 --> Ian Rubio out of the race with that same
<!-- 02:20 --> routine he looked pretty bad in those
<!-- 02:22 --> last debates new debates will look much
<!-- 02:24 --> more like those late debates then they
<!-- 02:26 --> have to move on to step two wait for the
<!-- 02:27 --> consolidation they have to pretend that
<!-- 02:29 --> the old establishment is the new
<!-- 02:30 --> anti-establishment everybody who's anti
<!-- 02:32 --> Trump but used to be establishment is
<!-- 02:34 --> now the new anti-establishment
<!-- 02:35 --> so the Trump people made a bet they bet
<!-- 02:38 --> that the establishment wing of the GOP
<!-- 02:40 --> would get behind them if they could
<!-- 02:42 --> threaten them into conciliation
<!-- 02:43 --> historically it's a pretty good bet
<!-- 02:45 --> Obama made the same bet he got he
<!-- 02:47 --> constantly threatened and cajole
<!-- 02:49 --> Republicans and it always paid off now
<!-- 02:51 --> Marco Rubio is making ridiculously funny
<!-- 02:54 --> noises about how Trump is coming around
<!-- 02:57 --> and has become more mature John Boehner
<!-- 02:59 --> the former Speaker of the House says
<!-- 03:00 --> Cruz is Satan incarnate and he'd vote
<!-- 03:02 --> for Trump over Hillary but not Cruz
<!-- 03:04 --> Trump is overtly defending Senate
<!-- 03:06 --> Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in
<!-- 03:08 --> Indiana former governor mitch Daniels
<!-- 03:10 --> has kept quiet and current Governor Mike
<!-- 03:12 --> Pence reluctantly endorsed Cruz but then
<!-- 03:14 --> said nice things about Trump GOP leaders
<!-- 03:16 --> are getting behind Trump for a few
<!-- 03:17 --> reasons first they don't want the party
<!-- 03:19 --> split second they want the cash anytime
<!-- 03:22 --> there's an election they get a lot of
<!-- 03:23 --> cash and third they actually like
<!-- 03:25 --> Trump's leftist program even if they
<!-- 03:27 --> don't like Trump personally okay third
<!-- 03:29 --> thing that the Trump stirs are prepared
<!-- 03:30 --> to do they're preparing for the crash so
<!-- 03:32 --> the Trump stirs are really worried that
<!-- 03:34 --> Trump's gonna lose and so they're
<!-- 03:35 --> preparing their stabs in the back myth
<!-- 03:37 --> early they're relying on these first two
<!-- 03:39 --> steps that are claiming Trump is a super
<!-- 03:41 --> powerful wonderfully brilliant candidate
<!-- 03:43 --> and they're gonna say even the
<!-- 03:44 --> establishment got behind him and then if
<!-- 03:46 --> they lose they're gonna say that the
<!-- 03:48 --> evil nasty conservatives wrecked the
<!-- 03:49 --> whole thing in t√ºnel put it this way
<!-- 03:51 --> this way at National Review
<!-- 03:53 --> he said if Trump is the nominee it's not
<!-- 03:55 --> gonna matter what anti Trump
<!-- 03:56 --> conservatives do leading up to November
<!-- 03:58 --> if he wins supporters will try it out
<!-- 04:00 --> the guillotine if he loses they'll throw
<!-- 04:01 --> it out the guillotine they just want to
<!-- 04:02 --> see heads roll this has been the
<!-- 04:04 --> animating impulse from the beginning at
<!-- 04:06 --> the heart of the Trump phenomenon is a
<!-- 04:07 --> blood thirst and one way or another
<!-- 04:09 --> there will be blood now the Trump people
<!-- 04:11 --> have to push this narrative or they'll
<!-- 04:13 --> be blamed for nominating the most
<!-- 04:14 --> despised person in modern politics and
<!-- 04:17 --> thus losing the presidency to the most
<!-- 04:18 --> despised leftist in modern politics
<!-- 04:20 --> that'll turn twenty twenty four years
<!-- 04:22 --> from now into a brawl between the Trump
<!-- 04:24 --> supporters the people who initiated this
<!-- 04:27 --> stupid pathetic Beer Hall Putsch and
<!-- 04:28 --> those who oppose them the burden is now
<!-- 04:31 --> on the Trump stirs they're about to find
<!-- 04:33 --> out that if you like the match for the
<!-- 04:35 --> Burnet all town movement that's not
<!-- 04:36 --> quite the same thing as sitting in the
<!-- 04:38 --> center of the house while the walls are
<!-- 04:40 --> flaming i'm ben shapiro this is the ben
<!-- 04:41 --> shapiro show so we're back from passover
<!-- 04:51 --> and this week's episode is sponsored by
<!-- 04:54 --> the post Passover laxative let my people
<!-- 04:56 --> go and it's a and it was a great
<!-- 05:00 --> vacation I'm so glad that I had it and
<!-- 05:02 --> I'm so sad that I get to come back the
<!-- 05:04 --> day before Armageddon it's just that
<!-- 05:06 --> it's it's bad vacation scheduling like
<!-- 05:08 --> we're gonna schedule a vacation
<!-- 05:09 --> preferably you do it when Armageddon is
<!-- 05:11 --> actually happening you don't come back
<!-- 05:13 --> right before the sweet meteor of death
<!-- 05:15 --> hits the earth and obliterates all life
<!-- 05:17 --> that's the time when you would prefer to
<!-- 05:19 --> be on the vacation not coming back the
<!-- 05:21 --> day before Indiana newest poll from The
<!-- 05:23 --> Wall Street journal/nbc shows that Trump
<!-- 05:25 --> is up 40 49 to 35 over Ted Cruz which of
<!-- 05:29 --> course has everybody who cares about the
<!-- 05:32 --> Republic everybody who thinks Trump will
<!-- 05:34 --> be bad for the Republic shredding their
<!-- 05:36 --> clothing and and ripping their and
<!-- 05:38 --> ripping their clothes and gnashing their
<!-- 05:40 --> teeth and beep decking themselves with
<!-- 05:42 --> ash or they like to call it the Glenn
<!-- 05:45 --> Beck show but in any case but that's
<!-- 05:48 --> sort of what what a lot of us are
<!-- 05:51 --> becoming in any case it's very sad
<!-- 05:52 --> Donald Trump is poised to to win Indiana
<!-- 05:54 --> there are two different polls that came
<!-- 05:56 --> out over the weekend one shows Cruz way
<!-- 05:58 --> ahead and then one shows that the Trump
<!-- 06:00 --> is way I had the one that shows Trump
<!-- 06:02 --> way ahead is the NBC Wall Street Journal
<!-- 06:04 --> one the one that shows Cruz ahead is
<!-- 06:05 --> some nowhere poll from Indiana so take
<!-- 06:09 --> that for what it is worth the
<!-- 06:10 --> establishment couldn't be happier about
<!-- 06:11 --> this by the way the establishment which
<!-- 06:13 --> I've been saying for months was going to
<!-- 06:15 --> swing behind Donald Trump when the chips
<!-- 06:17 --> were actually down when there's only one
<!-- 06:18 --> way to stop Trump and that was gonna be
<!-- 06:20 --> them they would cave and that's what
<!-- 06:22 --> they're doing and so what you're
<!-- 06:23 --> starting to see is this new call from
<!-- 06:25 --> the from the elite in the Republican
<!-- 06:28 --> Party that Trump is actually fine
<!-- 06:29 --> secretly he's okay it's all just been a
<!-- 06:31 --> big ruse you know this is this whole
<!-- 06:32 --> thing is it'll be okay it'll be okay and
<!-- 06:34 --> Cruz really is desperate now yes of
<!-- 06:36 --> course Cruz is desperate one of the
<!-- 06:38 --> things making him desperate is that you
<!-- 06:40 --> guys keep
<!-- 06:40 --> saying that he's desperate like it turns
<!-- 06:42 --> out that when everybody in the
<!-- 06:43 --> establishment jumps onto the seesaw on
<!-- 06:45 --> donald trump's very heavy side then
<!-- 06:48 --> that's going to make cruz a little bit
<!-- 06:50 --> more desperate so here's newt gingrich
<!-- 06:52 --> rolling out like the bowling ball that
<!-- 06:53 --> he is talking about how indiana is life
<!-- 06:56 --> or death for ted cruz what do you think
<!-- 06:58 --> you think indiana is the make-or-break
<!-- 07:00 --> situation I mean if Trump wins Indiana
<!-- 07:02 --> is it over oh sure look in Indiana is
<!-- 07:07 --> make-or-break for Cruz and it's a bump
<!-- 07:10 --> in the road for Trump if Cruz can't win
<!-- 07:14 --> Indiana and by when I mean get virtually
<!-- 07:16 --> all the delegates do something like
<!-- 07:18 --> close to what he did in Wisconsin
<!-- 07:20 --> there's no possibility that he can stop
<!-- 07:22 --> Trump that it'll just be over sometime
<!-- 07:24 --> Wednesday morning on the other hand if
<!-- 07:27 --> Trump doesn't do particularly well in
<!-- 07:29 --> Indiana he has so much overall momentum
<!-- 07:32 --> and it's such a huge lead that he could
<!-- 07:35 --> still win by winning in New Jersey in
<!-- 07:37 --> California in June 7th so for Trump it
<!-- 07:40 --> is a significant event for Cruz it's
<!-- 07:42 --> life and death well it's becoming that
<!-- 07:44 --> because people like Gingrich over the
<!-- 07:45 --> past few weeks have been throwing their
<!-- 07:47 --> rather ample support behind Donald Trump
<!-- 07:50 --> and he's not the only one David Brooks
<!-- 07:51 --> who really doesn't like Trump very much
<!-- 07:53 --> he hates Cruz even more I mean David
<!-- 07:55 --> Brooks despises Cruz because he thinks
<!-- 07:57 --> that Ted Cruz is just the word he said
<!-- 07:59 --> that he has I think he called it a
<!-- 08:01 --> satanic impulse toward darkness
<!-- 08:03 --> something ridiculous like that David
<!-- 08:05 --> Brooks who actually is a leftist he's a
<!-- 08:06 --> leftist masquerading as a right winger
<!-- 08:08 --> David Brooks says he's the the in-house
<!-- 08:10 --> conservative over a PBS and New York
<!-- 08:12 --> Times he says the Cruz is drowned and
<!-- 08:14 --> Cruz is collapsing and all the rest of
<!-- 08:16 --> it the second thing that's happened is
<!-- 08:18 --> not only Trump is strong but Cruz looks
<!-- 08:20 --> a lot weaker and flailing about with
<!-- 08:23 --> Carly Fiorina and the alleged Kasich
<!-- 08:26 --> deal that looks like the acts of a
<!-- 08:29 --> drowning man and so just in terms of the
<!-- 08:32 --> moral rigor the motivation force the
<!-- 08:35 --> morale Cruz is collapsing and Trump is
<!-- 08:40 --> surging so I agree with Mark and you
<!-- 08:42 --> don't have to look quite so happy about
<!-- 08:43 --> it there David Karl Rove - seems a
<!-- 08:46 --> little he's coming around - you're
<!-- 08:47 --> seeing the entire Republican
<!-- 08:48 --> establishment jump on this bandwagon now
<!-- 08:49 --> look there's objective analysis Cruz is
<!-- 08:52 --> desperate Cruz has to win
<!-- 08:54 --> if he doesn't win Indiana it is over
<!-- 08:56 --> essentially unless something unforeseen
<!-- 08:58 --> happens Donald Trump spontaneously
<!-- 09:00 --> combusts from from dusting his face with
<!-- 09:03 --> the hot cheetos instead of the regular
<!-- 09:04 --> cheetos or something like that but it's
<!-- 09:07 --> true
<!-- 09:07 --> Donald Trump is probably going to be the
<!-- 09:09 --> nominee but the point that I'm making is
<!-- 09:11 --> that the talk about Cruz you can see
<!-- 09:13 --> there's like a little bit of Glee behind
<!-- 09:14 --> a lot of these folks talking about how
<!-- 09:16 --> Cruz is basically done and the reason
<!-- 09:18 --> that he's basically done is because
<!-- 09:19 --> these people have blown up in the last
<!-- 09:21 --> two weeks
<!-- 09:21 --> Trump's victories which he was expected
<!-- 09:23 --> to win on the East Coast into while this
<!-- 09:25 --> is over now he won New York he won
<!-- 09:26 --> Delaware clearly he's gonna sweep they
<!-- 09:29 --> the media helped craft a feeling of
<!-- 09:30 --> momentum it's what they do after Iowa
<!-- 09:32 --> the media did not push the notion that
<!-- 09:34 --> Ted Cruz had a lot of momentum going
<!-- 09:36 --> into New Hampshire they said oh he's
<!-- 09:37 --> gonna get killed in the New Hampshire
<!-- 09:38 --> and he actually did much better than
<!-- 09:39 --> expected in New Hampshire the media
<!-- 09:41 --> helps craft the momentum conversation
<!-- 09:43 --> and they're really behind the Trump
<!-- 09:45 --> train right now and which is why Trump
<!-- 09:47 --> will probably win Indiana tomorrow and
<!-- 09:49 --> he'll probably win it in bigger numbers
<!-- 09:50 --> than people think he will Karl Rove does
<!-- 09:52 --> the same thing Rove has been making
<!-- 09:53 --> secret quiet overtures toward backing
<!-- 09:56 --> Trump because he wants his American
<!-- 09:57 --> Crossroads super PAC to be relevant in
<!-- 09:59 --> the general election he doesn't want to
<!-- 10:02 --> take himself out of play and so here is
<!-- 10:03 --> the the panel on Fox News Sunday Chris
<!-- 10:06 --> Wallace who is a Trump backer and it
<!-- 10:09 --> looks like I think kimberly guilfoyle
<!-- 10:10 --> who's trump back or karl rove who is a
<!-- 10:13 --> who's a quasi trump back or one williams
<!-- 10:15 --> who is kind of a quasi trump backer
<!-- 10:17 --> and george will the only person on the
<!-- 10:19 --> panel who doesn't like donald trump but
<!-- 10:20 --> there's there's karl rove in the center
<!-- 10:22 --> again why this man is considered a
<!-- 10:24 --> legitimate political figure is beyond me
<!-- 10:26 --> after he ran up and down the halls of
<!-- 10:27 --> Fox News during the last election cycle
<!-- 10:29 --> like a character from Harry Potter
<!-- 10:32 --> haunting the bathrooms like Moaning
<!-- 10:35 --> Myrtle
<!-- 10:35 --> here is ears Karl Rove he said of Trump
<!-- 10:38 --> won Indiana it could all be went over
<!-- 10:41 --> right so look this is not a strategic
<!-- 10:44 --> move this was a tactical move the Acela
<!-- 10:46 --> primary was a night of good night for
<!-- 10:48 --> Donald Trump and what better way to stop
<!-- 10:51 --> people in Indiana from focusing on that
<!-- 10:53 --> then naming your vice presidential
<!-- 10:54 --> running mate and spending a lot of time
<!-- 10:56 --> in Indiana and so they you know it was a
<!-- 10:58 --> desperate move but it it may have shut
<!-- 11:01 --> down a certain amount of the coverage of
<!-- 11:03 --> Trump's a sello primary win and spend a
<!-- 11:06 --> little bit more
<!-- 11:06 --> I'm on the pizzaz of a vice presidential
<!-- 11:08 --> running mate and they're eager the media
<!-- 11:10 --> is eager to make it into into a cruise
<!-- 11:12 --> out Trump in routine ejt oh and he's a
<!-- 11:15 --> leftist he's trying to push the
<!-- 11:17 --> horserace narrative now and this is what
<!-- 11:18 --> the entire media are going to do there's
<!-- 11:20 --> a real horse race Trump can win this
<!-- 11:21 --> thing you're already starting to see
<!-- 11:23 --> that narrative out today as I suggested
<!-- 11:24 --> earlier this is the first step in the
<!-- 11:26 --> narrative the first step is Trump can
<!-- 11:27 --> win then it's the establishment jumps on
<!-- 11:29 --> the bandwagon because they like the
<!-- 11:31 --> money and they they'll I want to keep
<!-- 11:32 --> the doors open and then finally it'll be
<!-- 11:34 --> Trump loses and he loses pretty big and
<!-- 11:36 --> then they turn around and they say well
<!-- 11:37 --> it's because of all you conservatives
<!-- 11:39 --> who wouldn't back him in the first place
<!-- 11:40 --> EJ Dionne is on the Left he's pushing
<!-- 11:42 --> that the horse race narrative here he is
<!-- 11:44 --> trade trade trade and industrialization
<!-- 11:47 --> and that's his whole card if he could
<!-- 11:50 --> win those Rust Belt states that are
<!-- 11:52 --> traditionally democratic you win the
<!-- 11:53 --> election his problem is I on Matt's
<!-- 11:56 --> point the country may say we're on the
<!-- 12:00 --> wrong track but Barack Obama's numbers
<!-- 12:01 --> have gone over 50% as he said last night
<!-- 12:05 --> and if Barack Obama is doing that well
<!-- 12:08 --> in November it's gonna be very hard for
<!-- 12:10 --> Trump to advance that argument and I
<!-- 12:12 --> think whatever he picks up among voters
<!-- 12:14 --> concerned about trade and those issues
<!-- 12:18 --> he's gonna lose with those massive
<!-- 12:19 --> negative numbers he has among women so I
<!-- 12:22 --> think his path is very difficult but if
<!-- 12:24 --> there is a path for him it's in the Rust
<!-- 12:27 --> Belt and it's with young voters not
<!-- 12:30 --> voting in the same in the numbers that
<!-- 12:32 --> he'll remain interesting Christie helps
<!-- 12:34 --> with he helps bring them out but okay so
<!-- 12:36 --> the idea is that this will be a more
<!-- 12:38 --> competitive race than everybody thinks
<!-- 12:39 --> now I want to talk a little bit how
<!-- 12:41 --> Trump can win okay how Trump can
<!-- 12:43 --> actually win so I don't think that it's
<!-- 12:45 --> going to be as much of a cakewalk
<!-- 12:46 --> because even I have been saying Hillary
<!-- 12:48 --> over Trump I do think that Hillary will
<!-- 12:50 --> end up winning I do think she'll win a
<!-- 12:51 --> lot of states that Trump has put into
<!-- 12:52 --> play but if Trump wins it's really going
<!-- 12:55 --> to be just because the left is so
<!-- 12:57 --> terrible which is what makes this whole
<!-- 12:58 --> thing really frustrating for me because
<!-- 13:01 --> if Trump wins because the left is just
<!-- 13:02 --> so terrible that means that Cruz could
<!-- 13:04 --> have won just because the left is so
<!-- 13:05 --> terrible
<!-- 13:06 --> and then we could have a constitutional
<!-- 13:07 --> conservative as president of the United
<!-- 13:09 --> States not this bloviating big state
<!-- 13:11 --> buffoon right if the left is so terrible
<!-- 13:13 --> that anybody could have won which is
<!-- 13:15 --> basically the premise because the only
<!-- 13:17 --> other premise is basically that Trump
<!-- 13:18 --> attacks a lot
<!-- 13:20 --> but Trump's attacks backfire as often as
<!-- 13:22 --> they strike but if Trump wins it's going
<!-- 13:25 --> to be because the people who are on the
<!-- 13:26 --> other side are so terrible so one of the
<!-- 13:28 --> big narratives that's emerged over the
<!-- 13:29 --> last few days has been all of the
<!-- 13:31 --> protesters at Trump at Trump rallies
<!-- 13:33 --> that there a lot of protests are showing
<!-- 13:35 --> up in harassing people and this is true
<!-- 13:37 --> and when I watch this stuff as somebody
<!-- 13:39 --> who ardently does not like Donald Trump
<!-- 13:41 --> somebody who ardently dislikes Donald
<!-- 13:43 --> Trump I understand the sympathy for
<!-- 13:45 --> Donald Trump when you look at this stuff
<!-- 13:47 --> so here are a bunch of Hispanic kids
<!-- 13:49 --> protesting one of trumps appearances in
<!-- 13:51 --> California and here's what it looked
<!-- 13:52 --> like
<!-- 13:56 --> you have people driving past here Trump
<!-- 13:59 --> signs and sees a bunch of Bernie Sanders
<!-- 14:01 --> holding Latino kids there and they are
<!-- 14:08 --> and they're flipping the boards these
<!-- 14:10 --> people driving past
<!-- 14:13 --> shaking her powers he's clapping but all
<!-- 14:17 --> these kids what 12 years old maybe 1012
<!-- 14:20 --> days older than their flipping off the
<!-- 14:22 --> cars that are passing I look at this and
<!-- 14:24 --> I say you're holding a Mexican flag and
<!-- 14:25 --> we're in a sombrero and you're flipping
<!-- 14:26 --> off the cars that are passing I have a
<!-- 14:28 --> lot of sympathy for the people who
<!-- 14:29 --> oppose you even if I don't like the
<!-- 14:31 --> people who oppose you and this is what's
<!-- 14:33 --> the the Trump movement is an anti
<!-- 14:36 --> movement it's an anti movement it's an
<!-- 14:37 --> anti everything movement and it's an
<!-- 14:39 --> anti these people movement so more
<!-- 14:41 --> prominent these folks are the better off
<!-- 14:42 --> Trump is going to be another event over
<!-- 14:45 --> the weekend there is a bunch of
<!-- 14:46 --> protesters who clashed with the police
<!-- 14:48 --> and at a trump event here's what that
<!-- 14:49 --> looked like protesters in California
<!-- 14:54 --> tried stopping the billionaire in his
<!-- 14:56 --> tracks clashing with police breaking
<!-- 14:58 --> down barricades even fighting with a
<!-- 15:00 --> trump supporter the most violent
<!-- 15:02 --> opposition to a Trump appearance it's a
<!-- 15:03 --> cancer event in Chicago last month they
<!-- 15:06 --> forced the candidate to take a winding
<!-- 15:07 --> detour to a GOP convention near San
<!-- 15:09 --> Francisco that was not the easiest
<!-- 15:12 --> entrance I've ever made my wife called
<!-- 15:16 --> she said there are helicopters following
<!-- 15:17 --> you and we did and then we went under a
<!-- 15:20 --> fence and through a fence and boy I felt
<!-- 15:23 --> like I was crossing the border actually
<!-- 15:27 --> crossing the border but I got here it's
<!-- 15:31 --> a funny line and this is what creates
<!-- 15:33 --> the feeling of popularity for Trump
<!-- 15:35 --> because the people who face him are such
<!-- 15:37 --> dimwits the people who face him are so
<!-- 15:39 --> terrible right it's sort of the same
<!-- 15:41 --> feeling I'm sure there are people who
<!-- 15:42 --> dislike me and when I go and speak on a
<!-- 15:44 --> campus and people try to throw people
<!-- 15:46 --> who want to hear lecturers around and
<!-- 15:48 --> start beating them up people start to
<!-- 15:49 --> have sympathy for my point of view just
<!-- 15:51 --> because the people who are protesting me
<!-- 15:53 --> are so terrible here's another Trump
<!-- 15:55 --> supporter they showed him briefly there
<!-- 15:57 --> and Sean Hannity described this guy is
<!-- 16:00 --> somebody walking through hell okay let's
<!-- 16:01 --> be real about this like this isn't a
<!-- 16:03 --> schvitz and it's not Normandy okay then
<!-- 16:05 --> quite hell and the guy is choosing in
<!-- 16:07 --> fact to walk through a bunch of leftist
<!-- 16:09 --> protesters but it does show that there
<!-- 16:12 --> are a bunch of people out there on the
<!-- 16:13 --> Left who are violent
<!-- 16:14 --> there they are flying Mexican flags and
<!-- 16:16 --> honestly trying to beat up a guy who's
<!-- 16:19 --> wearing a make America great again hat
<!-- 16:25 --> of course is a pro from videos
<!-- 16:27 --> correlation to Christopher
<!-- 16:31 --> video subscribe number one but number
<!-- 16:34 --> two if this guy and he's walking he's
<!-- 16:36 --> getting all feisty
<!-- 16:46 --> and finally here's a trump protester
<!-- 16:53 --> explaining why it is that these
<!-- 16:56 --> protesters are doing what they're doing
<!-- 16:57 --> this was on MSNBC over the weekend can
<!-- 17:00 --> you tell us just how this escalated how
<!-- 17:02 --> this kind of gotten out of control I
<!-- 17:04 --> don't think it is out of control I think
<!-- 17:05 --> that what you're seeing is people
<!-- 17:06 --> express righteous rage at the fact that
<!-- 17:09 --> we've got this hateful bigot coming to
<!-- 17:11 --> speak in our state and they're saying no
<!-- 17:12 --> absolutely not was this action plan was
<!-- 17:15 --> his plan to be a peaceful protest or was
<!-- 17:17 --> it by any means necessary at this point
<!-- 17:20 --> we respect the diversity of tactics
<!-- 17:21 --> right we plan to to lock down the
<!-- 17:24 --> streets and keep him out and stop him
<!-- 17:25 --> from speaking and by any diversity of
<!-- 17:27 --> tactics you mean anything goes we mean
<!-- 17:29 --> that black and brown and poor people
<!-- 17:31 --> have a righteous rage and they have a
<!-- 17:32 --> right to express it in the way that they
<!-- 17:33 --> need to and and to prevent this man from
<!-- 17:36 --> speaking our state why is the anger show
<!-- 17:38 --> directed at this one person at Donald
<!-- 17:40 --> Trump what is the rage about because
<!-- 17:42 --> he's been inciting violence against
<!-- 17:44 --> black people and brown people and Muslim
<!-- 17:48 --> people and and giving a platform for
<!-- 17:51 --> basically hate speech and white
<!-- 17:52 --> supremacy to permeate the country you
<!-- 17:54 --> feel like rushing over the barriers and
<!-- 17:56 --> heading towards the entrance of a
<!-- 17:59 --> convention is the right way to approach
<!-- 18:00 --> this I think that we should be
<!-- 18:02 --> interrupting the convention and making
<!-- 18:03 --> sure that Donald Trump does not take
<!-- 18:04 --> stage today you planted into the bottom
<!-- 18:07 --> line is these people if Donald Trump
<!-- 18:09 --> becomes president because of these
<!-- 18:10 --> people it's because of these people and
<!-- 18:12 --> they're handing a talking point to the
<!-- 18:14 --> to the RNC so RNC communications
<!-- 18:16 --> director Sean Spicer he said this he was
<!-- 18:18 --> on CNN he says why is it that we never
<!-- 18:20 --> talk about the the anti-trump protesters
<!-- 18:21 --> who are getting violent but what was not
<!-- 18:24 --> as fun is to watch the violence outside
<!-- 18:25 --> of the Donald Trump rally last night
<!-- 18:28 --> John I want to just pull some pictures
<!-- 18:30 --> up of what happened last night these
<!-- 18:31 --> were anti-trump protesters they were
<!-- 18:33 --> turning over police cars they were just
<!-- 18:36 --> you know there's all sorts of vandalism
<!-- 18:39 --> yeah so what I mean how much of a
<!-- 18:41 --> concern do you have my word Shawn about
<!-- 18:45 --> these scenes that we're seeing
<!-- 18:47 --> well I'll tell you here's what's
<!-- 18:49 --> interesting when the issues happen in
<!-- 18:51 --> Chicago a few months ago it was the
<!-- 18:54 --> Republican National Committee and
<!-- 18:55 --> members of folks on our side that called
<!-- 18:56 --> out and said we agree this sort of
<!-- 18:58 --> violence is unacceptable but yesterday
<!-- 19:00 --> you heard absolute silence when folks on
<!-- 19:02 --> the Left went and caused this absolute
<!-- 19:04 --> just a disrespectful nature caused
<!-- 19:07 --> violence just you know any public
<!-- 19:09 --> property silence from the DNC silence
<!-- 19:12 --> from hill okay
<!-- 19:12 --> they are such hypocrites when it comes
<!-- 19:14 --> to voting rights Sean on the mountain
<!-- 19:16 --> right now $67 right now they said
<!-- 19:18 --> nothing when it comes to violence yet
<!-- 19:20 --> they say nothing hold on oh it's
<!-- 19:21 --> interesting they're always willing to
<!-- 19:23 --> call out everybody else yeah when it's
<!-- 19:24 --> their side okay disrupt it it creates
<!-- 19:27 --> violence then I will announce it right
<!-- 19:29 --> now it's a peaceful protest should be
<!-- 19:33 --> peaceful absolutely and I hope you join
<!-- 19:35 --> me too in denouncing your local
<!-- 19:37 --> Republican Party chairman in Broward
<!-- 19:39 --> County Florida who last night said the
<!-- 19:40 --> most offensive misogynistic thing that
<!-- 19:43 --> anyone has said on this campaign and
<!-- 19:45 --> it's largely driven because the RNC has
<!-- 19:47 --> stood by and not stood up to Donald
<!-- 19:49 --> Trump so this is it so again the
<!-- 19:52 --> contrast here is what's going to help
<!-- 19:53 --> Donald Trump because I'm the one hand
<!-- 19:55 --> you have Sean Spicer who's saying you
<!-- 19:56 --> guys won't even stand up to people who
<!-- 19:57 --> overturn cop cars and on the left you
<!-- 20:00 --> have their spokesperson and he's saying
<!-- 20:02 --> yeah well we don't like when they do
<!-- 20:05 --> that but you should really condemn the
<!-- 20:06 --> comments of this person there's a
<!-- 20:08 --> difference as I like to say between
<!-- 20:09 --> action and words okay somebody saying
<!-- 20:12 --> something can be something you don't
<!-- 20:13 --> like it can be something offensive it
<!-- 20:15 --> can be Donald Trump saying stupid things
<!-- 20:16 --> give me lots of things violent action of
<!-- 20:19 --> course is the line that once you cross
<!-- 20:21 --> it there is no return and SOIC waiting
<!-- 20:23 --> the two things is very dangerous stuff
<!-- 20:25 --> the idea that Donald Trump says
<!-- 20:26 --> something that's the equivalent of
<!-- 20:27 --> people surrounding cars and overturning
<!-- 20:29 --> them that's absurd that's absurd and
<!-- 20:31 --> that is the road to fascism and that's
<!-- 20:33 --> why Trump is seeing a significant base
<!-- 20:35 --> of support because hit the opposition to
<!-- 20:37 --> Trump and this is the problem for folks
<!-- 20:39 --> like me I oppose both Trump and the
<!-- 20:41 --> opposition of Trump right the the people
<!-- 20:43 --> who you're seeing in these streets I
<!-- 20:44 --> think they're awful I think they're
<!-- 20:45 --> terrible I also think the Trump is awful
<!-- 20:47 --> and terrible but not in the same way or
<!-- 20:49 --> it's a trump is awful and terrible
<!-- 20:50 --> because he says a lot of things that I
<!-- 20:52 --> think are really terrible I think has a
<!-- 20:53 --> lot of bad positions I think he hangs
<!-- 20:55 --> out with bad people I think he
<!-- 20:56 --> incentivizes bad people
<!-- 20:57 --> I think he's incoherent on policy I
<!-- 20:59 --> think the people who face him are worse
<!-- 21:01 --> right because they're actually engaging
<!-- 21:03 --> in violent action but this puts me in a
<!-- 21:05 --> small minority because people tend to
<!-- 21:07 --> think in binary terms people tend to
<!-- 21:09 --> think in binary terms Jeremy boring
<!-- 21:11 --> who's the managing editor over at Daily
<!-- 21:13 --> wire he likes to give the example I
<!-- 21:16 --> think I've talked about before he likes
<!-- 21:17 --> to give the example that people love
<!-- 21:19 --> Star Wars but Luke Skywalker is one of
<!-- 21:22 --> the most boring heroes in movies
<!-- 21:23 --> what makes Luke Skywalker the hero is
<!-- 21:25 --> that you open the movie with Darth Vader
<!-- 21:27 --> you open the movie with a guy in a 7
<!-- 21:29 --> foot tall guy in a black death mask
<!-- 21:31 --> bursting open a door and forced choking
<!-- 21:33 --> somebody picking him up from the ground
<!-- 21:34 --> and choking him to death for no reason
<!-- 21:36 --> right just crushing his crushing his
<!-- 21:38 --> larynx for know his windpipe for no
<!-- 21:40 --> reason and then you and then they cut to
<!-- 21:41 --> Luke who's a whiny teenager like oh that
<!-- 21:43 --> guy must be the hero okay in this
<!-- 21:45 --> scenario Darth Vader is these protesters
<!-- 21:47 --> and Donald Trump is Luke Skywalker but
<!-- 21:50 --> what if Luke Skywalker is actually just
<!-- 21:52 --> like not a great guy what if Luke
<!-- 21:53 --> Skywalker in that case is Bubba Fett if
<!-- 21:55 --> they just cut - Bubba Fett now Bubba
<!-- 21:56 --> Fett is the is the is the good guy right
<!-- 21:57 --> because the guy who cut - after the
<!-- 21:59 --> worst person must be the best person and
<!-- 22:02 --> that's and that's how how the mind
<!-- 22:04 --> operates in terms of Trump versus his
<!-- 22:06 --> opposition and so for example you see
<!-- 22:09 --> that sort of stuff and then you see
<!-- 22:10 --> Trump getting all pugnacious and and
<!-- 22:11 --> he's asked about Vincent a fox in the
<!-- 22:14 --> wall and he says the way his usual line
<!-- 22:16 --> the wall just got 10 feet taller right
<!-- 22:17 --> you look at Trump doing this and you go
<!-- 22:19 --> okay I get this the former President of
<!-- 22:22 --> Mexico Vicente Fox he said today and I'm
<!-- 22:25 --> quoting him he said I'm not going to pay
<!-- 22:28 --> for the effing wall so if you don't get
<!-- 22:33 --> an actual check from the Mexican
<!-- 22:35 --> government for eight or ten or twelve
<!-- 22:37 --> billion dollars whatever it will cost
<!-- 22:39 --> how are you going to make them pay for
<!-- 22:41 --> the wall I will and the wall just got
<!-- 22:45 --> ten feet taller believe me and that's
<!-- 22:48 --> when you get the big yells right is it
<!-- 22:49 --> flashback to the debate it's that sort
<!-- 22:51 --> of feel from Donald Trump
<!-- 22:52 --> he's a counter puncher this is his
<!-- 22:54 --> routine I'm a counter puncher okay so
<!-- 22:56 --> that's how Trump can win is if the left
<!-- 22:58 --> is so terrible that the person who
<!-- 22:59 --> counts her punches against the left
<!-- 23:01 --> becomes more popular and Hillary is so
<!-- 23:03 --> terrible Hillary's irritating and
<!-- 23:05 --> annoying and awful a Hillary Clinton she
<!-- 23:08 --> said that for example here's a good
<!-- 23:10 --> juxtaposition so Hillary is so bad she
<!-- 23:12 --> makes Trump look funny and good by
<!-- 23:14 --> contrast
<!-- 23:15 --> so Hillary said over the weekend that
<!-- 23:16 --> when she has to deal with how will she
<!-- 23:18 --> deal with Donald Trump well she knows
<!-- 23:20 --> how to deal with men off the reservation
<!-- 23:21 --> is clip 20 here's Hillary Clinton
<!-- 23:23 --> talking about Donald Trump I have a lot
<!-- 23:25 --> of experience dealing with men who
<!-- 23:27 --> sometimes get off the reservation and
<!-- 23:30 --> the way they behave and how they speak
<!-- 23:33 --> I'm not gonna deal with their temper
<!-- 23:35 --> tantrums or their bullying or their
<!-- 23:38 --> efforts to try to provoke me he can say
<!-- 23:41 --> whatever he wants to say about me I
<!-- 23:42 --> could really care less I'm gonna stand
<!-- 23:44 --> up for what I think the American people
<!-- 23:47 --> need and want in the next president
<!-- 23:50 --> that's why I've laid out very specific
<!-- 23:52 --> plans there's nothing secret about what
<!-- 23:54 --> I want to do with the economy with
<!-- 23:55 --> education with health care with foreign
<!-- 23:57 --> policy I've laid it all out there
<!-- 23:59 --> and he can't go sushi I can't tell two
<!-- 24:02 --> things one she looks like death second
<!-- 24:04 --> she sounds like a skull right I've dealt
<!-- 24:06 --> with men who get off the reservation
<!-- 24:07 --> before I've dealt with men who get off
<!-- 24:08 --> the reservation before except of course
<!-- 24:10 --> the reservation where her husband lived
<!-- 24:13 --> in which case she just brought the
<!-- 24:14 --> hookers to him I mean she basically was
<!-- 24:16 --> his procurer but in any case Trump says
<!-- 24:18 --> that until the contrast is going to
<!-- 24:20 --> benefit trust here's Trump responding to
<!-- 24:22 --> that to that comment from Hillary it's
<!-- 24:24 --> it is funny she has taken from others a
<!-- 24:28 --> lot of heat having to do with that
<!-- 24:30 --> statement and I think it's a very hard
<!-- 24:32 --> state but it's basically like I can
<!-- 24:35 --> handle men don't worry about me I can
<!-- 24:37 --> handle men if somebody said that if I
<!-- 24:39 --> made that say but about women there'd be
<!-- 24:42 --> a front page headlines yeah you
<!-- 24:43 --> basically just about I can handle men
<!-- 24:49 --> now I won't even bring up the fact that
<!-- 24:52 --> the Indians have gone wild on that
<!-- 24:54 --> statement you know that okay the Indians
<!-- 24:56 --> have said that that statement is a
<!-- 24:57 --> disaster statement and they want a
<!-- 24:59 --> retraction I'm not going to get into
<!-- 25:01 --> that but that have you just heard
<!-- 25:05 --> they're not bringing that up I'm saying
<!-- 25:06 --> that has been I think a very I think
<!-- 25:10 --> it's a very nasty statement to men and
<!-- 25:13 --> if I made that statement it would be a
<!-- 25:15 --> big big story okay so so Trump is
<!-- 25:19 --> fighting back on her level and because
<!-- 25:20 --> she's nasty and harridan and he's also
<!-- 25:22 --> nasty and in a horror show they'll fight
<!-- 25:25 --> it out on that level with each other so
<!-- 25:28 --> I'm
<!-- 25:29 --> that way in that way Trump could win now
<!-- 25:31 --> here's the problem here's where Trump
<!-- 25:33 --> goes wrong and this is the problem okay
<!-- 25:34 --> Trump the benefit of Trump is if you
<!-- 25:36 --> were just if you really were everything
<!-- 25:37 --> he says he is you were just a
<!-- 25:38 --> counter-puncher that's all he wore you
<!-- 25:40 --> know people attack him he hits them back
<!-- 25:41 --> really hard if that's just to what his
<!-- 25:43 --> candidacy was he'd be in good shape but
<!-- 25:45 --> that's not all he is Donald Trump is
<!-- 25:47 --> also a sideshow and because he's a
<!-- 25:49 --> sideshow the media will turn on him in a
<!-- 25:51 --> New York minute they will break him so
<!-- 25:53 --> the media made him and the media will
<!-- 25:54 --> break him can the media made him they
<!-- 25:56 --> spent 30 years portraying him as this
<!-- 25:58 --> master of the financial universe this
<!-- 25:59 --> whiz kid who comes from nowhere and
<!-- 26:02 --> makes himself into this massive brand
<!-- 26:04 --> and the whole deal and they spent two
<!-- 26:06 --> billion dollars worth of media coverage
<!-- 26:08 --> in this primary alone to help push him
<!-- 26:10 --> and now they're going to destroy him
<!-- 26:12 --> because all of the sideshow nonsense if
<!-- 26:14 --> it's initiated by Hillary denier
<!-- 26:16 --> responds that's not sideshow he's good
<!-- 26:18 --> at that he legitimately legitimately
<!-- 26:20 --> he's good at it it's his best trait it's
<!-- 26:22 --> what he's good at if he has to initiate
<!-- 26:24 --> action he's in serious trouble when he's
<!-- 26:26 --> left to his own devices he's in Syria
<!-- 26:28 --> listen I said back in 2011 that if the
<!-- 26:31 --> man had any discipline he'd be President
<!-- 26:32 --> we're about to find out whether he has
<!-- 26:34 --> any discipline at all so here is you
<!-- 26:36 --> know the sideshow here's the part of the
<!-- 26:38 --> sideshow campaign so you remember two
<!-- 26:40 --> weeks ago Donald Trump said he'd let
<!-- 26:41 --> Caitlyn Jenner use a women's restroom in
<!-- 26:43 --> his Trump Tower so Caitlyn Jenner took
<!-- 26:45 --> him up on it and decided to truck on
<!-- 26:47 --> over to Trump Tower and then use the
<!-- 26:50 --> restroom over there and Caitlyn Jenner a
<!-- 26:52 --> very beautiful woman and and here we go
<!-- 26:56 --> oh my god
<!-- 27:04 --> now I love this okay last week Donald
<!-- 27:06 --> Trump said I could take a pee anywhere
<!-- 27:09 --> in a Trump facility so I am gonna go
<!-- 27:12 --> take a pee in the ladies room
<!-- 27:20 --> it's not a man folks that's women keep
<!-- 27:22 --> remembering and then here comes Caitlyn
<!-- 27:26 --> Jenner into the lobby asking where the
<!-- 27:29 --> ladies room is they tell them where the
<!-- 27:31 --> ladies room is he's eight feet tall and
<!-- 27:35 --> he's go to the men's room because he has
<!-- 27:38 --> a willy he's gonna go into the women's
<!-- 27:40 --> room and and that's where the tape cuts
<!-- 27:43 --> out now it is funny to me that the tape
<!-- 27:46 --> cuts out there presumably because you
<!-- 27:49 --> don't want to show what happens in the
<!-- 27:50 --> women's room it gets real awkward and it
<!-- 27:51 --> turns out that he's standing facing the
<!-- 27:53 --> toilet in order to go peepee they always
<!-- 27:55 --> stop it right where that cuts out
<!-- 27:56 --> because the offensive part actually
<!-- 27:58 --> happens inside the door when he takes
<!-- 28:00 --> out his very feminine penis and begins
<!-- 28:02 --> peeing in the women's room but this is
<!-- 28:04 --> part of the Trump sideshow campaign
<!-- 28:05 --> because now this is all over the news
<!-- 28:07 --> Caitlyn Jenner peeing in Trump Tower and
<!-- 28:10 --> now all over the news
<!-- 28:12 --> Donald Trump talking about Mike Tyson
<!-- 28:13 --> Mike Tyson is of course the famous boxer
<!-- 28:15 --> who is a convicted rapist he did three
<!-- 28:18 --> years in he was I guess a resident in
<!-- 28:20 --> Indiana for three years while he was in
<!-- 28:21 --> the State Penitentiary he was actually
<!-- 28:23 --> in prison in Indiana and Mike Tyson came
<!-- 28:26 --> out and endorsed Trump say yeah like I
<!-- 28:28 --> like Donald Trump Donald Trump's great
<!-- 28:29 --> heat the bet Donald Trump he's such a
<!-- 28:31 --> tough guy I'll give Mike I got ya eat
<!-- 28:34 --> his children so Donald Trump well so
<!-- 28:37 --> Donald Trump was asked about this Ted
<!-- 28:39 --> Cruz came out he said Donald Trump
<!-- 28:41 --> touted this first of all and Ted Cruz
<!-- 28:43 --> said well you know I don't go around
<!-- 28:45 --> touting endorsements from rapists here's
<!-- 28:47 --> Donald Trump coming back at Ted Cruz via
<!-- 28:51 --> Chris Wallace it just shows what a liar
<!-- 28:53 --> he is so Mike Tyson over the Internet
<!-- 28:56 --> endorsed me he said I endorsed mr. Trump
<!-- 28:58 --> he said that that was it no big deal I
<!-- 29:00 --> didn't have a meeting or anything I
<!-- 29:01 --> haven't seen Mike in years but he said
<!-- 29:03 --> he endorsed me so Cruz is now saying oh
<!-- 29:05 --> he was a rapist this guy's are realized
<!-- 29:08 --> that's why we call him lyin Ted Cruz I
<!-- 29:09 --> mean the greatest life that I've lived
<!-- 29:10 --> except he gets caught every time except
<!-- 29:13 --> he gets caught every time he's a
<!-- 29:14 --> convicted rapist convicted okay not even
<!-- 29:17 --> accused like Bill Clinton
<!-- 29:18 --> convicted went to jail I know the
<!-- 29:20 --> prosecutor Greg garrison
<!-- 29:22 --> he's talk show hosts over in Indiana
<!-- 29:24 --> convicted rapists but but Ted Cruz's a
<!-- 29:26 --> liar so how do you think that's gonna
<!-- 29:28 --> play in general when he's saying that
<!-- 29:30 --> convicted rapists are not actually
<!-- 29:31 --> rapists
<!-- 29:31 --> by the way Donald Trump going back 20
<!-- 29:33 --> years was too
<!-- 29:34 --> and Mike Tyson from the rape allegations
<!-- 29:36 --> suggesting in fact that the Mike Tyson
<!-- 29:38 --> had been sort of suckered into this
<!-- 29:41 --> whole thing and that and the Desiree
<!-- 29:43 --> Washington the woman who accused him of
<!-- 29:44 --> rape was actually just trying to get him
<!-- 29:46 --> Trump of course was running his casinos
<!-- 29:48 --> at that time and wanted Tyson to be able
<!-- 29:50 --> to box there so here's a tight he says
<!-- 29:52 --> again this is the Trump sideshow
<!-- 29:54 --> so if Trump were just the counter
<!-- 29:55 --> puncher he'd be fine he's the sideshow
<!-- 29:57 --> also so Donald Trump says Mike Tyson is
<!-- 29:59 --> not a rapist and anyone who calls Mike
<!-- 30:00 --> Tyson a rapist despite the fact he was
<!-- 30:02 --> convicted of rape is a liar but there is
<!-- 30:05 --> one kind of rape that Donald Trump
<!-- 30:07 --> doesn't like and that is economic rape
<!-- 30:09 --> so here's Donald Trump on China don't
<!-- 30:11 --> forget we're like the piggy bank that's
<!-- 30:13 --> being robbed we have the cards we have a
<!-- 30:15 --> lot of power with China when China
<!-- 30:17 --> doesn't want to fix the problem in North
<!-- 30:19 --> Korea we say sorry folks you gotta fix
<!-- 30:21 --> the problem because we can't continue to
<!-- 30:24 --> allow China to rape our country and
<!-- 30:27 --> that's what they're doing it's the
<!-- 30:29 --> greatest theft in the history of the
<!-- 30:31 --> world okay you can stop it there it's
<!-- 30:33 --> personal Ted Cruz is the greatest liar
<!-- 30:34 --> in the history of the world China
<!-- 30:36 --> manipulating its currency is the
<!-- 30:38 --> greatest theft in the history of the
<!-- 30:39 --> world not like I mean admittedly not
<!-- 30:42 --> quite not and maybe it's a little bit
<!-- 30:44 --> worse than like I don't know killing six
<!-- 30:45 --> million Jews and taking all their money
<!-- 30:46 --> but you know aside from that it's it's
<!-- 30:49 --> like the greatest theft in history or
<!-- 30:51 --> maybe you know the various mass Wars of
<!-- 30:54 --> attrition across the Middle East and
<!-- 30:56 --> across the maybe the stealing of oil and
<!-- 30:59 --> the nationalization of British Petroleum
<!-- 31:01 --> by a run now but but no the greatest
<!-- 31:03 --> theft in history is not actually theft
<!-- 31:04 --> it's just China trading with us but
<!-- 31:06 --> that's rape okay so Mike Tyson is not a
<!-- 31:07 --> rapist but China is an economic rapist
<!-- 31:10 --> okay again this is where the Trump
<!-- 31:12 --> sideshow begins to run off the rails and
<!-- 31:14 --> this is the problem for the Trump train
<!-- 31:15 --> is that if Trump just stayed on track if
<!-- 31:17 --> you were just fighting Hillary if he
<!-- 31:19 --> just wore the counter-puncher he'd be ok
<!-- 31:20 --> but he's not but he's not because he's
<!-- 31:23 --> all these other negative things and
<!-- 31:24 --> here's how things are gonna go here's
<!-- 31:26 --> how things are gonna go Harry Reid says
<!-- 31:27 --> look we're gonna win back the Senate
<!-- 31:28 --> Democrats are gonna win back the Senate
<!-- 31:30 --> because Donald Trump we all we need to
<!-- 31:32 --> pay up or to take the majority and with
<!-- 31:34 --> the numbers I'd give you it's going to
<!-- 31:36 --> be a fairly certain thing that we can do
<!-- 31:39 --> that okay and this continues here's that
<!-- 31:43 --> here's why the Democratic Senate
<!-- 31:45 --> takeover is likely they're now starting
<!-- 31:47 --> to run ads
<!-- 31:48 --> Tromp so this is the first time we're
<!-- 31:49 --> now nearing the Trump nomination to the
<!-- 31:51 --> point where Democrats feel comfortable
<!-- 31:52 --> spending their money on anti Trump ads
<!-- 31:54 --> so there's an ad that's now running in
<!-- 31:57 --> Arkansas and it's an ad that is that is
<!-- 31:59 --> running I'm trying to member the name of
<!-- 32:01 --> the candidate who's running this ad I'm
<!-- 32:03 --> bringing it up right now by cam but in
<!-- 32:05 --> any case his the the guy who's running
<!-- 32:07 --> this particular ad is he's running for
<!-- 32:10 --> Senate in Arkansas and he's running a
<!-- 32:11 --> guy against a guy named john Boozman
<!-- 32:13 --> who's the current senate senate senator
<!-- 32:15 --> in Arkansas it's Conner Eldridge the
<!-- 32:16 --> guy's name he's a Democrat here is the
<!-- 32:18 --> ad that he's now running against the
<!-- 32:20 --> Republican senator in Arkansas this is
<!-- 32:22 --> how the campaign is going to go because
<!-- 32:23 --> again Trump is a negative force he's not
<!-- 32:25 --> just an anti force he's a negative force
<!-- 32:27 --> too here's the ad that's running in
<!-- 32:29 --> Arkansas so for folks who couldn't eat
<!-- 32:34 --> he ate like a pig I'd look at right in
<!-- 32:36 --> that fat ugly face of hers
<!-- 32:37 --> he once sent her a picture of herself
<!-- 32:39 --> with the words the face of a dog or not
<!-- 32:42 --> somebody typing the word harassment he
<!-- 32:45 --> subjects someone to hostility you know
<!-- 32:49 --> they look like two light posts coming
<!-- 32:51 --> out of a body blood coming out of her
<!-- 32:53 --> wherever
<!-- 32:54 --> a person who's flat chested is very hard
<!-- 32:56 --> to be a 10 you don't think you could get
<!-- 32:58 --> it up for her I think I'd have a hard
<!-- 32:59 --> time Wow
<!-- 33:00 --> no I don't find her attractive and then
<!-- 33:05 --> goes back to explain what harassment is
<!-- 33:07 --> you dropped to your knees pretty picture
<!-- 33:10 --> you drop
<!-- 33:15 --> like you wouldn't have your job if you
<!-- 33:17 --> weren't beautiful did I put together a
<!-- 33:18 --> montage of Marla Donald's have her what
<!-- 33:21 --> is it like when she is in bed with you
<!-- 33:23 --> God it is a beautiful instruction with
<!-- 33:25 --> no question
<!-- 33:27 --> Trump enabler this is Arkansas Senator
<!-- 33:31 --> John goes right so the idea is that
<!-- 33:33 --> Boozman supports Trump support the
<!-- 33:37 --> candidate regardless of who we pick
<!-- 33:38 --> whether Donald Trump it certainly would
<!-- 33:41 --> be a lot better presidency and then it
<!-- 33:46 --> goes to Conner Eldridge in there that's
<!-- 33:47 --> the rest of ya doesn't matter so that's
<!-- 33:49 --> the point okay Trump's negatives are
<!-- 33:51 --> very real it's not just that he's anti
<!-- 33:53 --> it's that he's an active negative force
<!-- 33:55 --> so he's a package deal you're getting
<!-- 33:57 --> the the guy who's gonna throw the
<!-- 33:58 --> kitchen sink you're getting the guy
<!-- 33:59 --> who's gonna hit people with a hammer
<!-- 34:00 --> he's also the guy who's always a hammer
<!-- 34:03 --> and if in hammering people badly and a
<!-- 34:06 --> negative ways and in nasty ways for
<!-- 34:08 --> legitimately years now what's sad about
<!-- 34:10 --> all of this again is that Hillary is so
<!-- 34:12 --> vulnerable if you're just anti-hillary
<!-- 34:14 --> you have a good shot at winning if
<!-- 34:16 --> you're anti Hillary Hillary such a shrew
<!-- 34:18 --> she's such a shrieking harpy of evil but
<!-- 34:20 --> if you just went out there and ran
<!-- 34:22 --> against her you'd be in great shape but
<!-- 34:24 --> Trump has so much baggage there's so
<!-- 34:26 --> much that that is negative about Trump
<!-- 34:28 --> Hillary is just going to eat him up on
<!-- 34:30 --> all of those things and so when and the
<!-- 34:33 --> Trump support base but again this is the
<!-- 34:35 --> disconnect right that well the point
<!-- 34:36 --> that I'm making is a pretty objective
<!-- 34:38 --> one Trump is good in some ways but he's
<!-- 34:40 --> really bad in some ways and the ways
<!-- 34:42 --> that he's bad are really gonna hurt him
<!-- 34:43 --> the Trump support base though is so
<!-- 34:45 --> passionate because they're anti because
<!-- 34:47 --> they're anti and because Trump is anti
<!-- 34:49 --> things they now assume his from support
<!-- 34:51 --> base assumes that everything that Trump
<!-- 34:53 --> is anti is something worth being anti so
<!-- 34:55 --> there's an exchange that happened it was
<!-- 34:59 --> today
<!-- 34:59 --> earlier this morning Ted Cruz was
<!-- 35:01 --> campaigning in Indiana he was confronted
<!-- 35:03 --> by a Trump supporter and it looked just
<!-- 35:05 --> to give you sort of a hint as to well
<!-- 35:08 --> let's play a little bit of it here's
<!-- 35:10 --> here's Ted Cruz meeting a Trump
<!-- 35:12 --> supporter and you're about to see why
<!-- 35:14 --> this election has gone so badly because
<!-- 35:15 --> the anti feeling feeling of resist has
<!-- 35:18 --> now been extended to even people who are
<!-- 35:20 --> constitutional conservatives not just
<!-- 35:22 --> the actual enemy people like Hillary
<!-- 35:24 --> Clinton because for Trump and for
<!-- 35:25 --> Trump's people Hillary isn't necessarily
<!-- 35:26 --> the enemy everybody who
<!-- 35:27 --> not Trump is the enemy even if not
<!-- 35:33 --> everyone in this process though I'll
<!-- 35:35 --> tell you this election so I appreciate
<!-- 35:41 --> your coming out I appreciate your coming
<!-- 35:43 --> out I think anyone that wants to be
<!-- 35:48 --> President others to the people of this
<!-- 35:50 --> state to come in front and ask for your
<!-- 35:52 --> support and I'm running to be everyone's
<!-- 35:54 --> president those who vote for me we don't
<!-- 35:56 --> want you you're entitled to you sir not
<!-- 35:58 --> will respect it in fact I'll be the bass
<!-- 36:01 --> drop out it's your turn
<!-- 36:03 --> well take your own word now I'm curious
<!-- 36:06 --> sir I'm drop out when journal doesn't
<!-- 36:08 --> get to 1237 in a couple definitely gonna
<!-- 36:11 --> get a 37 he's gonna get more than 12
<!-- 36:15 --> what what do you like about that
<!-- 36:17 --> everything you'd give me one everything
<!-- 36:20 --> give me one okay the world that's the
<!-- 36:25 --> main thing you're a great chef
<!-- 36:28 --> now do you know on the wall that Donald
<!-- 36:31 --> told the New York Times editorial boards
<!-- 36:33 --> not gonna build a wall he's not gonna
<!-- 36:34 --> deport anyone well sir civilized people
<!-- 36:42 --> don't yell at each other I'm not yelling
<!-- 36:57 --> okay and this is okay so basically this
<!-- 36:59 --> has now become the scene from tombstone
<!-- 37:02 --> where Kurt Russell is dealing at the
<!-- 37:04 --> casino and Mike right Ike Clanton comes
<!-- 37:07 --> up to him and this is the end this is
<!-- 37:09 --> the scene this is the exact scene here's
<!-- 37:10 --> what it looks like right wider you
<!-- 37:17 --> this is now mr. Kansas law dog law don't
<!-- 37:21 --> go around here savvy I'm retired
<!-- 37:25 --> good that's real good yeah yeah that's
<!-- 37:31 --> real good law dog cause law just don't
<!-- 37:33 --> go around here yeah for the first time
<!-- 37:35 --> winner to the king $500 that is that
<!-- 37:40 --> exchange right I mean he's got the same
<!-- 37:41 --> number of teeth right you got that guy
<!-- 37:43 --> and he's got three teeth talking to Ted
<!-- 37:45 --> Cruz Harvard Law grad and constitutional
<!-- 37:49 --> lawyer about a lion Ted well there you
<!-- 37:52 --> are lyin Ted you definitely had those
<!-- 37:54 --> Affairs that's true but when you side
<!-- 37:55 --> that New York Times them city people
<!-- 37:58 --> with their with their crazy words and
<!-- 38:01 --> such well now listen most southerners
<!-- 38:04 --> are not this guy they assume these in
<!-- 38:06 --> Indiana so it's not even that southern
<!-- 38:07 --> right he's Midwestern but this is it but
<!-- 38:09 --> but this is what a lot of Trump
<!-- 38:11 --> supporters have become because they're
<!-- 38:13 --> so anti things they're anti the Trump
<!-- 38:15 --> protesters I'll give them the benefit of
<!-- 38:16 --> the doubt I think a lot of the Trump
<!-- 38:17 --> people ardently support Trump because
<!-- 38:19 --> they were pushed into the Trump camp by
<!-- 38:21 --> a lot of people who were anti Trump
<!-- 38:23 --> originally the hard left in the media
<!-- 38:24 --> and now they've bought full into the
<!-- 38:26 --> dictatorial impulse nothing Trump says
<!-- 38:29 --> can be wrong what do you like about him
<!-- 38:30 --> everything I like everything like this
<!-- 38:32 --> house of his hands I think he's a nice
<!-- 38:33 --> ass everything all of the things about
<!-- 38:35 --> Donald Trump are wonderful let me tell
<!-- 38:37 --> you when he says he's got great
<!-- 38:39 --> appendages I believe I believe I believe
<!-- 38:41 --> every word he says
<!-- 38:42 --> and once you get to that point folks
<!-- 38:44 --> you've moved beyond the realm of
<!-- 38:46 --> rationality I fully understood the
<!-- 38:49 --> reactionary love for Donald Trump's
<!-- 38:51 --> candidacy but you have to acknowledge on
<!-- 38:53 --> an objective level that there are
<!-- 38:54 --> problems with Donald Trump is a
<!-- 38:56 --> candidate I've acknowledged on an
<!-- 38:57 --> objective level there are problems with
<!-- 38:59 --> my guy Ted Cruz as a candidate comes off
<!-- 39:01 --> like a snake oil salesman he comes off
<!-- 39:02 --> like a Baptist preacher and it's very
<!-- 39:04 --> difficult to feel that he's sincere
<!-- 39:06 --> Donald Trump is a bad man and comes off
<!-- 39:08 --> like a bad man hey you can acknowledge
<!-- 39:11 --> that and still support your guy but this
<!-- 39:12 --> whole routine were everything he does is
<!-- 39:14 --> right every single thing that he does is
<!-- 39:16 --> right Oh everything they're all great
<!-- 39:18 --> all the things are wonderful about
<!-- 39:20 --> Donald Trump you truly have to be
<!-- 39:21 --> foolish to believe this and if you buy
<!-- 39:24 --> into this if you buy into this all the
<!-- 39:25 --> way through the election you're gonna be
<!-- 39:26 --> in for a bad surprise because you're
<!-- 39:28 --> gonna think all the way up till the time
<!-- 39:29 --> he gets beat
<!-- 39:30 --> a thousand percent all the way up until
<!-- 39:32 --> the time he loses 43 states you're gonna
<!-- 39:34 --> be thinking that he's gonna win because
<!-- 39:35 --> that's all he does he just wins that's
<!-- 39:37 --> all he does he just lyin Ted crooked
<!-- 39:39 --> Hillary and if you just keep saying
<!-- 39:40 --> these things over and over I love
<!-- 39:42 --> everything it's just there's no way to
<!-- 39:44 --> convince those folks and those people
<!-- 39:46 --> will be the first people who are staying
<!-- 39:48 --> that that Trump was stabbed in the back
<!-- 39:49 --> when he loses even though we told you a
<!-- 39:51 --> year in advance that he was gonna get
<!-- 39:53 --> his butt kicked all right time for one
<!-- 39:56 --> thing that I like and then a couple of
<!-- 39:57 --> things that I hate all right so things
<!-- 39:59 --> that I like the Hilary mantel wrote a
<!-- 40:02 --> book called Wolf Hall that's very good
<!-- 40:04 --> it's now series on PBS show you like a
<!-- 40:05 --> little bit of the preview of the series
<!-- 40:07 --> the series is OK the book is much better
<!-- 40:09 --> but but the acting on the series is
<!-- 40:12 --> really good so here it's about Henry the
<!-- 40:14 --> 8th and and the the break-in the church
<!-- 40:18 --> and his marriage to Anne Boleyn
<!-- 40:20 --> I assume the series will take us all the
<!-- 40:22 --> way up to Anne Boleyn's beheading the
<!-- 40:24 --> first book takes you to Sir Thomas
<!-- 40:26 --> More's beheading but but it's a very
<!-- 40:28 --> good book and here's what the series
<!-- 40:30 --> looks like at last a man born in a more
<!-- 40:34 --> lowly state than myself Cromwell I knew
<!-- 40:38 --> there was something about you that I
<!-- 40:39 --> didn't like I swear to be a true and
<!-- 40:42 --> faithful counselor to the Kings majesty
<!-- 40:44 --> as one of his Highness's Privy Council
<!-- 40:46 --> you'll not find any talent I possess the
<!-- 40:49 --> England cannot use a trust in your
<!-- 40:53 --> discretion and your skill you made a
<!-- 40:55 --> mistake threatening me
<!-- 41:02 --> now is the time you to become the king
<!-- 41:05 --> you should be what you afraid what those
<!-- 41:10 --> who've been made can be unmade thank you
<!-- 41:13 --> people cuz you are a serpent everything
<!-- 41:16 --> that you everything that you have damian
<!-- 41:25 --> lewis is a terrific actor I first
<!-- 41:28 --> started to really like him when I watch
<!-- 41:29 --> Band of Brothers which is the best
<!-- 41:31 --> series ever on TV banda brothers a
<!-- 41:32 --> spectacular will have to do with things
<!-- 41:33 --> i like just on band of brothers because
<!-- 41:35 --> it's that good but that's where so the
<!-- 41:37 --> book itself Wolf Hall is what I've read
<!-- 41:39 --> I haven't seen the full series started
<!-- 41:41 --> to watch it and the series is okay but
<!-- 41:43 --> the book is much better so it will fall
<!-- 41:45 --> by Hilary mantel alright things that I
<!-- 41:47 --> hate Amy Schumer has now put out a new
<!-- 41:49 --> video on guns Amy Schumer is the is the
<!-- 41:51 --> gal who recently was on the cover of I
<!-- 41:53 --> can't remember which magazine it was it
<!-- 41:55 --> was one of the women's magazines and who
<!-- 41:57 --> was a picture of her setting her hoo-hoo
<!-- 41:58 --> on fire which is what syphilis will do
<!-- 42:01 --> to you by the way and and and she also
<!-- 42:03 --> is a far leftist who pushes anti-gun
<!-- 42:07 --> routine so she did this anti-gun routine
<!-- 42:09 --> this is her routine of selling guns this
<!-- 42:12 --> is what she thinks that this is why she
<!-- 42:13 --> thinks right when their cell done by
<!-- 42:15 --> guns here we go
<!-- 42:16 --> Amy Schumer now speaking of perfect
<!-- 42:17 --> gifts no this is a no-brainer all right
<!-- 42:20 --> no this is a gun just your regular
<!-- 42:23 --> run-of-the-mill meat-and-potatoes
<!-- 42:25 --> handgun now how cute is that it's like a
<!-- 42:36 --> toy but it's extremely real yeah I now
<!-- 42:39 --> here is what's great about this now
<!-- 42:40 --> pretty much anyone can purchase this
<!-- 42:43 --> okay oh my god this is so fun that's so
<!-- 42:52 --> fun and it's on sale now call in we got
<!-- 42:55 --> a call caller yeah you did you sure did
<!-- 43:00 --> honey but that's okay gun oh no I could
<!-- 43:03 --> never get a gun I have several violent
<!-- 43:04 --> felonies oh no all are you bite your
<!-- 43:08 --> tongue you silly goose you can
<!-- 43:09 --> absolutely get a gun
<!-- 43:11 --> you have several felonies as long as you
<!-- 43:13 --> buy it on the internet or at a gun show
<!-- 43:16 --> and caller none of these things are true
<!-- 43:18 --> everything every out what's so bad about
<!-- 43:20 --> this personals bad comedy because it's
<!-- 43:21 --> not funny in any way but beyond that
<!-- 43:23 --> every element of this is false all of
<!-- 43:26 --> the things about this are false it's
<!-- 43:27 --> very it's actually not that easy to buy
<!-- 43:29 --> a gun you have to be over a certain age
<!-- 43:30 --> they do a background check on you every
<!-- 43:31 --> federally licensed firearms dealer has
<!-- 43:34 --> to do a background check for felonies if
<!-- 43:35 --> you buy a gun over the internet it has
<!-- 43:37 --> to be shipped to a federally licensed
<!-- 43:39 --> firearms dealer you then have to go to
<!-- 43:40 --> that federally licensed firearms dealer
<!-- 43:42 --> for a background check the gun show
<!-- 43:44 --> loophole is not a real thing okay real
<!-- 43:46 --> firearms dealers at a gun show still
<!-- 43:48 --> have to do a background check on you the
<!-- 43:50 --> so-called gun show loophole is Vaisala
<!-- 43:51 --> done to Lindsay
<!-- 43:52 --> okay that's it that's not a gun show
<!-- 43:53 --> loophole that's a private party purchase
<!-- 43:55 --> loophole it's a different thing and
<!-- 43:57 --> there's been no evidence that private
<!-- 43:59 --> party purchases like that are what are
<!-- 44:00 --> leading to any sort of spike in gun in
<!-- 44:02 --> any case you wouldn't expect
<!-- 44:03 --> intelligence from a woman who sets her
<!-- 44:05 --> vagina on fire to show the world what a
<!-- 44:07 --> how she sets the world on fire
<!-- 44:08 --> presumably but this is a comedy in the
<!-- 44:11 --> service of leftism has now become the
<!-- 44:13 --> thing so over the weekend was the White
<!-- 44:15 --> House Correspondents Dinner
<!-- 44:16 --> and I hate hate the White House
<!-- 44:18 --> Correspondents Dinner there are two
<!-- 44:19 --> Washington spectacles I absolutely
<!-- 44:21 --> despise in every way it's possible to
<!-- 44:24 --> despise them the first Washington
<!-- 44:25 --> spectacle that I despise is the State of
<!-- 44:27 --> the Union it's an imperial dick taught
<!-- 44:29 --> that comes from a guy who's an elected
<!-- 44:31 --> official in front of other elected
<!-- 44:32 --> officials but when he walks into the
<!-- 44:34 --> chamber everybody cheers and now we all
<!-- 44:37 --> have to worship at his altar and it's
<!-- 44:39 --> gonna be great so that's the number one
<!-- 44:41 --> thing I the second thing I hate is the
<!-- 44:42 --> White House Correspondents Dinner
<!-- 44:43 --> because it's the media which is supposed
<!-- 44:47 --> to cover the president in all of the
<!-- 44:49 --> gory detail and the pilot and the
<!-- 44:51 --> president who's supposed to serve the
<!-- 44:52 --> media and the public and they get
<!-- 44:55 --> together and then they used to drink and
<!-- 44:56 --> they were tuxes and they feed each other
<!-- 44:58 --> and they talk about how they're best
<!-- 44:59 --> friends I don't want the media to be
<!-- 45:01 --> friends with the president the media
<!-- 45:02 --> coverage of george w bush was
<!-- 45:03 --> significantly better than any of the
<!-- 45:05 --> media coverage of barack obama because
<!-- 45:07 --> the media didn't like bush and they
<!-- 45:08 --> liked obama i said that so i hate this
<!-- 45:11 --> thing and i think that if i if you or
<!-- 45:13 --> somebody who's out of a job
<!-- 45:14 --> watching president obama wear a tux and
<!-- 45:16 --> sip champagne as he makes jokes with the
<!-- 45:18 --> celebrities you would think well maybe
<!-- 45:20 --> our political class is a little bit out
<!-- 45:21 --> of touch I'm voting for Donald Trump
<!-- 45:23 --> because of all of that even though
<!-- 45:24 --> Donald Trump
<!-- 45:25 --> these people he's both Hollywood and
<!-- 45:26 --> Washington DC so there are a couple of
<!-- 45:29 --> things that were particularly galling
<!-- 45:30 --> when you start with Obama's jokes Obama
<!-- 45:32 --> does this comedy routine and honestly if
<!-- 45:35 --> I were the President of the United
<!-- 45:37 --> States I think I would just tell them to
<!-- 45:39 --> stick it I think I would just I I would
<!-- 45:41 --> probably skip the event I probably just
<!-- 45:43 --> cancel the events altogether because
<!-- 45:44 --> they they call this thing nerd prom it's
<!-- 45:46 --> not nerd prom okay that all of these
<!-- 45:47 --> people are not nerds most of them are
<!-- 45:49 --> Talking Heads who are incredibly stupid
<!-- 45:50 --> but good-looking and so they're there
<!-- 45:52 --> and they're supposed to be nerds and
<!-- 45:54 --> they're joking with each other and it's
<!-- 45:55 --> just the whole thing just sticks in my
<!-- 45:57 --> craw in a real way here's President
<!-- 45:59 --> Obama joking about Donald Trump so this
<!-- 46:03 --> night is a testament to all of you who
<!-- 46:05 --> devoted your lives to that idea we had
<!-- 46:11 --> so much fun the last time and it is
<!-- 46:17 --> surprising you got a room full of
<!-- 46:20 --> reporters celebrities cameras and he
<!-- 46:23 --> says no is this bitter too tacky for the
<!-- 46:28 --> Donald what could he possibly be doing
<!-- 46:33 --> instead see no eating a trump steak
<!-- 46:38 --> tweeting out insults to Angela Merkel
<!-- 46:41 --> what's he doing and there's one area
<!-- 46:45 --> where Donald's experience could be
<!-- 46:46 --> invaluable and that's closing Guantanamo
<!-- 46:49 --> because Trump knows a thing or two about
<!-- 46:52 --> running waterfront properties into the
<!-- 46:54 --> ground okay I just wanna point one thing
<!-- 46:59 --> out play one more clip of this and then
<!-- 47:00 --> I want to point one thing out so here is
<!-- 47:01 --> President Obama talking about how warm
<!-- 47:04 --> he is with the prize how much he loves
<!-- 47:05 --> the press I know that there are times
<!-- 47:08 --> that we've had differences and that's
<!-- 47:10 --> inherent in our institutional roles it's
<!-- 47:14 --> true of every president and his press
<!-- 47:16 --> corps but we've always shared the same
<!-- 47:19 --> goal to root our public discourse in the
<!-- 47:23 --> truth to open the doors of this
<!-- 47:25 --> democracy to do whatever we can to make
<!-- 47:28 --> our country and our world more free and
<!-- 47:31 --> more just
<!-- 47:33 --> there is pretty media this is what I
<!-- 47:37 --> hate about President Obama's regime okay
<!-- 47:39 --> and it it his administration President
<!-- 47:42 --> Obama does this routine where now he's
<!-- 47:45 --> feeding the press he spends his entire
<!-- 47:46 --> administration prosecuting members of
<!-- 47:48 --> the press who attempted to uncover
<!-- 47:51 --> things about him he went after the AAP
<!-- 47:52 --> he bugged the AAP he sends his reporters
<!-- 47:55 --> he sent his DOJ after reporters from the
<!-- 47:57 --> Washington Post the media have said
<!-- 47:59 --> openly this is the least transparent
<!-- 48:00 --> White House in the history of White
<!-- 48:02 --> House's and yet there he is talking
<!-- 48:04 --> about how he has this close relationship
<!-- 48:05 --> with the media and are all they're
<!-- 48:06 --> clapping for yay that's what I hate
<!-- 48:09 --> about all of this and it's not just the
<!-- 48:11 --> media obviously it's also the folks in
<!-- 48:13 --> Hollywood so you saw Amy Schumer using
<!-- 48:15 --> comedy in the service of leftism
<!-- 48:17 --> or rather taking a gun to the head of
<!-- 48:19 --> comedy and pulling the trigger
<!-- 48:20 --> splattering its blame brains across the
<!-- 48:22 --> wall in service to to leftism Larry
<!-- 48:24 --> Wilmore who as I've said before is the
<!-- 48:26 --> second least funny human being on the
<!-- 48:27 --> planet after Trevor Noah Larry Wilmore
<!-- 48:29 --> was the guy who hosted this one and same
<!-- 48:32 --> deal same deal so his jokes about Obama
<!-- 48:35 --> basically fell flat they're really quite
<!-- 48:36 --> terrible his jokes about Trump were much
<!-- 48:39 --> more hard-hitting and then how he
<!-- 48:41 --> finished it up was was the big story of
<!-- 48:43 --> the day so here's Larry Wilmore
<!-- 48:45 --> finishing up remember he's the comedian
<!-- 48:46 --> he's the comedian right he's supposed to
<!-- 48:48 --> be the comic entertainment here is Larry
<!-- 48:49 --> Wilmore finishing up if this doesn't
<!-- 48:51 --> tell you everything you need to know
<!-- 48:52 --> about the nexus between Hollywood and
<!-- 48:54 --> the media and the White House this is it
<!-- 48:56 --> right here okay Larry Wilmore got praise
<!-- 48:58 --> nothing but praise for this from the
<!-- 48:59 --> media media thought this was brave and
<!-- 49:01 --> wonderful the same media that thought
<!-- 49:03 --> Stephen Colbert going on stage and
<!-- 49:04 --> calling George W Bush a liar in front of
<!-- 49:06 --> him at the White House Correspondents
<!-- 49:08 --> Dinner about ten years ago now they
<!-- 49:10 --> thought this was just the bravest thing
<!-- 49:11 --> they ever saw Larry Wilmore do here's
<!-- 49:13 --> Larry Wilmore talking about President
<!-- 49:14 --> Obama thank you for being a good sport
<!-- 49:16 --> mr. president but all jokes aside let me
<!-- 49:19 --> just say how much it means for me to be
<!-- 49:21 --> here tonight I've always joked that I
<!-- 49:23 --> voted for the president because he's
<!-- 49:24 --> black and people say would you agree
<!-- 49:27 --> with his policies normally I said I
<!-- 49:28 --> agree with the policy that he's black
<!-- 49:32 --> as long as it keeps being black I'm good
<!-- 49:34 --> you say what about Iraq is he still
<!-- 49:37 --> black but behind that joke is a humble
<!-- 49:41 --> appreciation for the historical
<!-- 49:43 --> implications for what your presidency
<!-- 49:44 --> means when I was a kid I lived in a
<!-- 49:47 --> country where people couldn't accept a
<!-- 49:50 --> black quarterback now think about that
<!-- 49:52 --> a black man was stopped by his near
<!-- 49:55 --> color not good enough to lead a football
<!-- 49:58 --> team and now to live in your time mr.
<!-- 50:02 --> president when a black man can lead the
<!-- 50:05 --> entire free world
<!-- 50:23 --> words alone do me no justice so mr.
<!-- 50:28 --> president I'm going to keep it 100 yo
<!-- 50:31 --> Barry you did it my nigga oh and Obama
<!-- 50:37 --> is so pleased because of course he spent
<!-- 50:38 --> his entire life searching for his black
<!-- 50:40 --> identity according to dreams for my
<!-- 50:41 --> father a couple of things worthwhile
<!-- 50:43 --> they're pointing out one he's a comedian
<!-- 50:44 --> he is not a political commentator second
<!-- 50:47 --> even if you were a comedian who does
<!-- 50:49 --> political comedy the idea that he's
<!-- 50:51 --> coming out in full and this isn't sure
<!-- 50:52 --> this is politician worship it's Trump
<!-- 50:54 --> like politician worship on the right and
<!-- 50:55 --> this is existed for Obama for a long
<!-- 50:57 --> time this sort of stuff created Trump in
<!-- 50:59 --> every way the worship for Obama created
<!-- 51:01 --> a feeling of worship on the other side
<!-- 51:03 --> of the aisle for the anti Obama the
<!-- 51:05 --> media's collusion with President Obama
<!-- 51:07 --> created a hatred for the media that
<!-- 51:09 --> allows Trump to get away with
<!-- 51:10 --> unbelievable lies I mean that's an
<!-- 51:12 --> amazing line what Larry Wilmore says
<!-- 51:13 --> there where he says have you do a groove
<!-- 51:15 --> his policy says if he keeps being black
<!-- 51:16 --> I grew his policies can you imagine a
<!-- 51:19 --> white person saying that can you imagine
<!-- 51:20 --> that
<!-- 51:20 --> end of the world pure racism right and
<!-- 51:23 --> then when he drops the n-word at the end
<!-- 51:24 --> of that everybody's supposed to be okay
<!-- 51:25 --> with that cuz a black man talking to
<!-- 51:27 --> another black man making a black guy in
<!-- 51:29 --> joke in front of the entire country
<!-- 51:31 --> right with the presidents who's supposed
<!-- 51:33 --> to be the presidents of all the people
<!-- 51:34 --> it really is appalling but this entire
<!-- 51:35 --> dinner is appalling and it demonstrates
<!-- 51:37 --> again that we've become a politics of
<!-- 51:40 --> celebrity we've become a politics of
<!-- 51:42 --> personal loyalty which is the scariest
<!-- 51:43 --> thing you combine those two personal
<!-- 51:45 --> loyalty and celebrity and what you end
<!-- 51:47 --> up with is a joke you end up with a
<!-- 51:49 --> circus but it's a tyrannical circus we
<!-- 51:51 --> used to be able to get away with this
<!-- 51:52 --> kind of crap when we had hero worship
<!-- 51:53 --> for people in 1840 with William Henry
<!-- 51:55 --> Harrison right he was a general but the
<!-- 51:58 --> president didn't do anything then now
<!-- 52:00 --> that's the most powerful office on the
<!-- 52:01 --> world in the world and we're talking and
<!-- 52:03 --> the only question is whether it ought to
<!-- 52:04 --> be controlled by Kanye West or whether
<!-- 52:06 --> it ought to be controlled by Justin
<!-- 52:07 --> Bieber that's basically that the
<!-- 52:09 --> conversation now and so we've got our
<!-- 52:11 --> own Kanye and Justin Bieber we have our
<!-- 52:13 --> own President Obama in Donald Trump just
<!-- 52:15 --> because he's anti things doesn't make
<!-- 52:17 --> him Pro the right things we'll talk
<!-- 52:19 --> tomorrow we've got tomorrow for the for
<!-- 52:21 --> the last episode the the ultimate
<!-- 52:23 --> episode before the apocalypse arrives
<!-- 52:25 --> we'll see if in the molded Pacific Rim
<!-- 52:27 --> we are able to cancel the apocalypse
<!-- 52:29 --> somehow being a pessimist I doubt it but
<!-- 52:32 --> we'll still be here in Clavin
<!-- 52:33 --> to feel better this afternoon will tell
<!-- 52:35 --> you some happy talk or something you
<!-- 52:37 --> know it's just the way there go but I'm
<!-- 52:38 --> here I'm here to depress you I'm back I
<!-- 52:39 --> got all the notes I'm here yep
